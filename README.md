                                          HOSPITAL QUEUE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
INTRODUCTION : 
This project is a Hospital Queue Management System developed in C++ using a linked list data structure.It simulates a real hospital environment where patients arrive at random times and are treated based on severity and age priority.The system ensures that critical and vulnerable patients are attended first while also simulating doctor availability and emergency situations.
OBJECTIVES:
Manage patient queues efficiently
Prioritize patients based on medical urgency
Simulate real hospital timing and workflow
Demonstrate linked list implementation in C++
KEY FEATURES:
Linked list–based patient queue
Priority-based insertion (no manual sorting needed)
Severity-based treatment order
Age-based priority for children and senior citizens
Emergency mode handling
Real-time clock simulation AM/PM
Random patient arrival intervals
Live queue display
USER MANUAL:
 Option 1: Enter Patient
Allows the user to enter:
Patient Name
Patient Age
Severity level (1–50)
The patient is inserted into the queue automatically at the correct position based on priority
 Option 2:Display Queue
Displays the current patient queue in a formatted table showing:
Serial Number
Name
Age
Severity
 Option 3: Emergency Mode
Activates emergency handling
Reduces treatment time
Emergency patients are processed faster
Option 4: End of Day
Ends the hospital simulation
Terminates the program
FUTURE IMPROVEMNETS:
Multiple doctors support
File handling for patient records
Graphical user interface 
Better emergency case handling
Memory cleanup using destructors
